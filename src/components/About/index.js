      <p>
        Hello, my name is Mitchell Heyn and I am an aspiring full-stack web
        developer! I am currently going through a coding bootcamp to improve my
        skills and get into a career in development! I graduated with a degree
        in Business Information Systems from the University of Utah in 2019, I
        fell in love with development in my limited experience in coding through
        the Information Systems program and decided to further my knowledge by
        going through a bootcamp. I enjoy spending time with my wife and family.
        I love anything to do with the Utah Jazz, whether it is watching a game
        or discussing the team with my friends and coworkers. I also enjoy
        playing soccer with friends and family.
